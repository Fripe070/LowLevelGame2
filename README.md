## Prerequisites
- [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html#installing-meson)
- [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (Windows only)

## Building
Run `debug.ps1` or `debug.sh` (depending on your system) to set up the project for development.
You can then run the binary located at `./build/debug/lowlevelgame.exe` or `./build/debug/lowlevelgame` (depending on your system).

Release builds are similar, with the scripts `release.ps1` and `release.sh`, and their executable in `build/release/` rather than `build/debug/`.


## Controls
Figure them out yourself
